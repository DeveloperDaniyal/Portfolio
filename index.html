        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Daniyal Zakir</strong>. I am from District Hyderabad. I completed my matriculation from St. Bonaventure High School and my intermediate studies from Iqra College. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in English Language and Linguistics at Mehran University of Engineering and Technology.</p>
        <p>My first-semester subjects include Pakistan Studies, Computer Science, Linguistics, Islamic Studies, Literature, and Functional English. I am eager to explore these areas further and also wish to dive into a variety of other fields. I am also studying website development and currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>My father is a school teacher at City College, and I have three siblings: two sisters and one twin brother named Ahsan. He is studying Electrical Engineering at Mehran University.</p>
